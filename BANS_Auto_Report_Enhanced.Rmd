# Abstract

The Fort Funston breeding colony of bank swallows has been observed since the early 1900's. Habitat loss and other factors led to bank swallows being listed as a threatened species under the California Endangered Species Act. The Fort Funston breeding colony of bank swallows may be one of only two remaining coastal breeding sites in California. The bank swallow colony has shifted locations along the bluffs at Fort Funston over the years, with bank swallows mainly nesting at `r area_name_map(HighestMaxBurs_Area)` in `r TargetYr`. The total number of bank swallow burrows at the Fort Funston colony has been declining since 2000. In `r TargetYr`, there were `r HighestMaxBurs_Count` bank swallow burrows counted at `r area_name_map(HighestMaxBurs_Area)``r if(active_burrows > 0) paste0(". ", num_to_word(active_burrows), " burrows were determined to be active")``r if(burrows_with_nestlings > 0) paste0(", with ", burrows_with_nestlings, " burrows containing a total of ", total_nestlings, " nestlings")`

`r if(drilled_burrows_used) paste0("In addition to monitoring in ", TargetYr, ", we tested drilling burrows, removing ice plant from accessible sections of bluff face, and placed temporary signage to try to keep people from disturbing active nesting areas.")`

# Introduction

The bank swallow (_Riparia riparia_) was listed as a threatened species under the California Endangered Species Act in 1989, after the species was extirpated from southern California and much of central California. The bank swallow range in California may have been reduced by as much as 50% (Zeiner et al. 1988). Habitat loss at breeding colony sites may continue to impact the species throughout the state. Fort Funston and Ano Nuevo State Park 65 km to the south are likely the only two extant coastal bank swallow breeding colonies remaining in California. Bank swallows have been known to nest in the bluffs at Fort Funston since at least the early 1900's (Laymon et al. 1987).

The National Park Service began systematically monitoring breeding bank swallows at Fort Funston each spring, beginning in 2000 (Figure 1). The monitoring program was designed to determine trends within the local breeding population, and to record potential disturbances to bank swallows and their nesting areas. Following severe bluff erosion in 2010, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission installed a rock revetment north of Funston Beach (Figure 1, Area B encompasses the suitable breeding habitat in the exposed bluff face above the rock revetment). From 2011-2019, most bank swallow burrows occurred in Area B in the bluff face above the revetment. In 2019, active burrows were discovered approximately two km south (outside the NPS boundary), along the bluffs of Phillip Burton Memorial Beach (Figures 1 and 2, Area PB), and this area was added to our monitoring program.

`r if(include_special_activities(as.numeric(TargetYr))) paste0("In ", TargetYr, ", we added, or continued, several elements to our regular burrow monitoring program, including monitoring burrows for nesting activity (started in 2022), drilling artificial burrows, removing accessible ice plant (Carpobrotus edulis) from suitable nesting bluff faces, and the installation of signage to protect active nesting areas. To see if bank swallows could be attracted to nest, we pilot tested drilling burrows prior to the arrival of bank swallows at the site. Before drilling, a geologic consultant assessed the bluffs for suitable drilling sites (Kleinfelder 2023). Overhanging ice plant was also removed to clear sections of bluff face for nesting opportunities.")`

# Objectives

The specific objectives of the bank swallow monitoring program are:

* To determine trends in the bank swallow population by tracking the total number of burrows as an index of the population.
* To monitor the spatial location of bank swallow burrows.
* To track the phenology of bank swallow arrival and nesting at the site.
* To collect information on bank swallow burrow use and nesting in primary nesting burrow clusters.
* To record data on various disturbances and potential disturbance factors.
* To utilize monitoring data to improve habitat protections and restoration and outreach for the Fort Funston bank swallow colony.

# Methods

## Burrow Transects

The Fort Funston bank swallow colony has been monitored using largely the same methods since 2000 (NPS 2022). Monitoring sectors were added to the surveys as bank swallow nesting locations shifted. Areas A and B were added to the initial survey area in 2010, and Area PB was added in 2019 (Figures 1 and 2). Surveys involve trained staff walking a transect beginning north of the rock revetment area at south Ocean Beach, parallel to the Great Highway Extension (Figure 1). Surveyors continue walking south to Phillip Burton Memorial Beach. Observers identify and record all bird species encountered, including bank swallows, and note the type of bank swallow activity observed. They count and record the number of bank swallow burrows within each area. The number of burrows is counted twice by each observer, once while walking south, and again on the return north to Ocean Beach. Observers also record potential disturbances to bank swallows, including humans climbing on cliffs, off-leash dogs, low-flying aircraft, etc. Surveys occur every 7-10 days throughout the nesting period, from mid-April through July or early August. Monitors try to conduct one survey right before the bank swallows have arrived (they are long distance Neo-tropical migrants that overwinter in South America) to determine how many burrows have persisted from previous years.

## Burrow Nesting Monitoring Surveys

Beginning in 2022, we did more intensive monitoring of the primary cluster of bank swallow nesting burrows to determine use. In `r TargetYr`, we continued nest monitoring surveys. These surveys focused on the areas with the most burrows and activity. Early season burrow transect surveys provide an indication of where to focus nest monitoring surveys. Once an area was selected, photos were taken of the area and then printed and laminated. These photos were used as a map to keep track of burrow identification. Surveys involved trained staff sitting in front of the focal burrow areas for one hour and recording bank swallow activity at a particular burrow and the time. Bank swallow activities are described as flying in/out of burrows, carrying fecal sacs, carrying food, carrying nesting material, and whether and how many nestlings are observed. Nest monitoring surveys occurred every 7-10 days during the nesting period and sometimes were done following burrow transect surveys. Surveys continued throughout the nesting period until no activity at the burrows was observed. Well after bank swallows had left Fort Funston, we used a borescope to examine accessible burrows in the area that we monitored for burrow nesting activity.

`r if(drilled_burrows_used) paste0("## Drilling Burrows\n\nWe worked with a geologist to identify locations along the bluffs at Fort Funston that matched previous bank swallow nesting locations with vertical bluff faces, above two meters in height, and with relatively soft substrates, and to provide design recommendations for burrow clustering to minimize potential destabilization of the bluff. Prior to the mid-April arrival of bank swallows, we established ", num_drilled_burrows, " total burrows with a depth of about two feet at ", drilled_burrow_locations, " locations along the bluffs, including adjacent to recent nesting burrows in the primary nesting area. Burrows were drilled using a gas-powered drill with a 3\" auger that was 23\" in length.")`

# Results

## Burrow Transects

`r num_to_word(numBT_Surveys)` bank swallow transect surveys were conducted between `r startBT` and `r endBT`, each lasting approximately 1.5 hours in duration (Table 1). The `r area_name_map(HighestMaxBurs_Area)` was the primary nesting area in `r TargetYr`, with a maximum count of `r HighestMaxBurs_Count` burrows`r if(drilled_burrows_used) paste0(" (this count includes ", num_drilled_burrows, " drilled burrows)")`.

Maximum counts of bank swallow burrows and locations have varied over time, though the total maximum number of burrows has declined over the monitoring period (Figure `r ifelse(drilled_burrows_used, 3, 2)`). A linear regression line for total bank swallow burrows over time demonstrates this declining trend in bank swallow burrows (R² = `r r_squared`, slope = `r slope` burrows/year). NPS bank swallow monitoring from 1993-1996 showed between `r historical_min` and `r historical_max` total burrows, indicating an even larger decline since that time (NPS 2007).

Bank swallow nesting locations have shifted along the bluffs at Fort Funston over time (Figure `r ifelse(drilled_burrows_used, 4, 3)`). `r if(HighestMaxBurs_Area == "AreaPB") paste0("Since 2020, bank swallow nesting has occurred primarily at the Phillip Burton Memorial Beach area.")`

# Discussion

Only two coastal breeding sites for bank swallows remain in California, making the Fort Funston population of high conservation importance. Our monitoring data going back to 2000 indicate that the Fort Funston bank swallow population is likely in severe decline (Figure `r ifelse(drilled_burrows_used, 3, 2)`). Loss of the Fort Funston bank swallow population would set back bank swallow recovery in the state and reduce local biodiversity. Bank swallows have been known to nest along the Fort Funston bluffs since the early 1900's.

The National Park Service (NPS) preserves and protects all native and sensitive wildlife, as well as migratory species. NPS management policies dictate that we protect state-listed wildlife as we would federally-listed species to the extent feasible (i.e., protect sensitive species and the habitat they depend on). To this end, we will continue to monitor bank swallows to detect trends in relative abundance and nesting locations, contribute to this long-term data set, and inform management for this state-threatened species and its limited nesting habitat. Management actions to protect bank swallow nesting include fencing, signage, habitat restoration and ice plant removal, and public outreach/education.
